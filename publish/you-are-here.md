This blog is a repository of my personal notes. 

I have always been a fan of publishing, as the critical intersection of culture and technology.
I was a voracious reader as a child, and admire figures such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer and William Hogarth in addition to numerous authors. This site is an experiment in both structure and cadence, being a sprawling and continuously-integrated system. 

Entries can cross-reference each other, like [[Wikipedia]]. 

Some information is also referenced under tags like #code and #writing, though the published version of this blog doesn't support it yet.
