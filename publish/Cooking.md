I enjoy cooking. 

Some of my favorite things to make include dishes with fish, bread, and anything Italian. 

For most meals, I will collect a handful of recipes online, consult the better cooks in my life, and improvise based on what I have in hand. I have a handful of recipes that, when in season, become a weekly habit. 

Some of my recipes: 

[[Whitman's Tiramisu]]

[[Whitman's Focaccia]]
