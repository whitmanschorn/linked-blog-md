Ingredients


Mascarpone
Sugar
Eggs

Pull 5 double shots of espresso

Combine 4 egg yolks and 4 heaping tablespoons of powdered sugar, whisk together until the color of pale yellow moonlight

Pour a shot of bourbon. Throw half into the mixture and have the other half for yourself 

Add 250-300g mascarpone, whip until smooth and fluffy


Whip 2 cups of cream in the vitamix, add into the bowl

Now, add 1/2 cup of almond milk to the espresso,
Crush up a bag of chocolate-covered pretzels,
and begin to assemble:
A layer of cookies: dip the cookies in for 2 seconds each side, then place
A layer of cream
A layer of sifted cocoa powder
A layer of cookies
A layer of creak
Crushed pretzels
A layer of cocoa powder

And you're done!

Let chill overnight in the fridge. 

Maybe next time add vanilla?
I used egg whites based on a recipe but I don't think that is as good as whipped cream
