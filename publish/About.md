My name is Whitman Schorn

I was born in Austin in 1991.

I graduated Oberlin College in 2013, majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing. I then moved to New York City for the next 8 years. I currently divide my time between Austin and Brooklyn. 

I enjoy writing, technology, and the intersection of the two. 

If you want to know me, this site is great place to start. You can check out some of my favorite [[Books]], what I'm watching on [[Youtube]], see my recipes in [[Cooking]], or just generally peruse.
