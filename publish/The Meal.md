This is a rough outline of a recipe inspired by my typical lunch order at[ Dig (formerly Dig Inn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(restaurant))
When getting lunch in manhattan, this was one of the healthiest and most satisfying meals I could put together. I ended up getting it for lunch so often I made it at home. I ended up making it at home so often I began referring to it as 'the meal', at one point being a solid plurality of my meals. 

It's 3 basic parts:

- Chicken breast, optionally coated in a mix of gochujang & honey
- Sweet potatoes seasoned with yuzu kosho and a spice blend
- Brussels sprouts tossed in olive oil and chili flakes

Optionally, you can add brown rice or quinoa as a base.

All three are then roasted in an oven until the chicken is juicy, the potatoes are burnt at the edges, and the sprouts are filigreed with edges of caramelized lace. It helps to let the oven really build up heat, get to 475 and possibly even put a pizza stone or other heavy cookware in the oven while it warms up as a thermal battery.

Once done, throw everything in a bowl and drizzle aioli on top.
